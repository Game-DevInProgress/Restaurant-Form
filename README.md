# Restaurant-Form
Created a functional restaurant viewer application to view 3 different restaurants using nodejs and javascript

# How to run server:

First start by downloading package.json file to get all of the dependencies for the server. When this is done just go
to the terminal and type 'node restaurant_server.js'. Then go to your browser of choice and go to the localhost by typing
'localhost:3000/' in the search bar.
